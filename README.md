# A tree structure to work with PhaseMapping module
## Todos
- [x] Define Node struct
- [x] Proper test script for BFS
- [x] Breadth-first-search
- [ ] Implement best first search
    - [ ] Build lookup table structure
    - [ ] Function fro proper lookup
- [ ] Depth-first-search (low priority)
- [ ] Math model for probabilistic estimation
- [ ] Might want to put proper docstring

## Development log
### 5/29
* Implementing BFS on trees, logically (Working on)
* Pseudo test script (Working on)
* Understanding julia type declaration
* General algorithm done, now just have to implement and know how to interface with Sebastian's existing code.

### 5/31
* Minor bug fix
* test script ready

### 6/29
* Settled Node structure
* Settled Tree structure
* Tree constructor implemented
* Breadth-first-traversal done

### 6/30
* Implement Breadth-first-search
* Write test
* Termination condition??

### 8/1
* Separate the tree module from PhaseMapping module
* Improved testing code
